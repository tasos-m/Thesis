## Title 
Employing Machine Learning and Intelligent Information Management Techniques for efficient Software Requirements Elicitation

## Abstract 
Proper definition of functional requirements is a prerequisite for succesful software project development. Inaccurate and/or missing functional requirements are among the top reasons that lead to failure of the software development process, since incomplete definition of functional requirements results in erroneous scheduling of necessary tasks and subsequently failure in the implementation of the software project.

This dissertation initially builds a dataset of functional requirements of software projects from various sources, which is missing from bibliography. Then an ontology is defined, that captures the static view of a software project. The functional requirements of the dataset are mapped to the defined entities and the data is efficiently stored using the ontology format.

In the next step, machine learning algorithms are employed in order to extract recommendations for better software requirements elicitation.  For the evaluation of their performance the models are fed with take a new software project with incomplete functionality as input and the extracted recommendations are evaluated.
